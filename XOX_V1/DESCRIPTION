How to play:
Start the game and wait untill your friend (opponent) joins and makes the first move.
You can directly make the first move, if you have joined as the 2nd player.
Then, you can play one by one.

IMPORTANT:
In this version, when a player initializes the game, the game randomly assigns the client to 'X' or 'O' and waits for an opponent to join and make the first move.
While waiting for the opponent, the gui does not respond and it might freeze. But it only lasts untill the opponent makes a move.
IF A PLAYER QUITS WITHOUT USING THE CLOSE BUTTON OR THE PROGRAM CRASHES, CLIENT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INFORM THE SERVER.
If that happens, the game might crash at start or the 2nd player that joins might have problems.
IN THIS CASE, CLOSE THE GAME AND USE RESET.EXE TO RESET THE SERVER FILES. THIS WILL CLEAR THE DATA ON THE SERVER SO DO NOT USE THIS DURING THE GAME.
After resetting, you can restart the game.

This game runs on each client and transmits data through a public FTP server.
The game is playable but not perfect in this version.
There are no skores or lobies and the game shuts itself when the session ends. (win/draw/mid-game exit/error)
Only one game with two players can play it at a time because the game currently uses only one file with one byte on the public server.
